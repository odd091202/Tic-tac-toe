âš¡ Notes:
- Replace the **screenshot link** with a real screenshot from your game (upload an image in your repo and link it).
- Once you enable **GitHub Pages**, update the **Live Demo** link so people can play.  

Do you want me to also give you a **nice project folder structure** suggestion (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`) for uploading?
